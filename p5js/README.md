# p5.js Mode

## Installation

(Tested with Processing 4.4.7 on MacOS Monterey 12.7.6)

Install the mode by double-clicking the released `.pdex` file. After Processing has started up, hit "Yes" on the opening dialog, and let the mode get installed into your Processing sketchbook folder. Currently, you need to restart Processing to have the new p5.js mode show up in the mode dropdown. (This will be looked into for the September release candiate that will be published until September 30 end of day.)

After restarting Processing, choose “p5.js” from the mode dropdown. If `pnpm` is not found on your system, Processing will automatically install it and the LTS Node version. The status bar in the PDE will tell you once it is ready for you to code on your sketch.
